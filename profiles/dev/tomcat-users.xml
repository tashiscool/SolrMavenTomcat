        well, this seems kind of sketchy from a security standpoint, but system
        properties will be expanded in this file, which makes automating
        deployments nice and easy!

        ${tomcat.username} and ${tomcat.password} should NOT be filtered by
        Maven.  They should be set via system properties, coordinated through
        setenv.sh.

        Note that for Tomcat 7 onwards, the roles required to use the manager
        application were changed from the single manager role to the following
        four roles. You will need to assign the role(s) required for the
        functionality you wish to access.
            manager-gui - allows access to the HTML GUI and the status pages
            manager-script - allows access to the text interface and the status pages
            manager-jmx - allows access to the JMX proxy and the status pages
            manager-status - allows access to the status pages only

        Additionally, for enhanced security, they say you should not apply the
        manager-gui and manager-text roles to the same user, or the new CSRF
        security will be defeated.
